**Task Manager App**

I tried building a simple task manager using Next.js. 

I deployed it here:
https://ugac-assignment-three.vercel.app/

**Tech Stack**

-Next.js 15

-React

-LocalStorage (no backend used)

-CSS (no Tailwind)

---

**Features**

-Add a task 

-Edit a task

-Delete a task

-See all your tasks in a list

-Tasks saved in your browser, even if you reload 

Each task has:

-Title

-Description

-Due Date

-Priority (Low / Medium / High)

-Tags (comma separated)

-Status (Todo / In Progress / Done)


---

**How Data is Stored**

I used localStorage to store all tasks. So if you refresh, your tasks won’t go away.
(but if you clear your browser cache, it will)


**Live Link**

I deployed it here:
https://ugac-assignment-three.vercel.app/

I didn’t add filtering/sorting yet.
